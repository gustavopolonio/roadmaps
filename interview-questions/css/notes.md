# 1 - Can you explain how do you handle CSS responsiveness? Also discuss CSS Flexbox and Grid layout systems. How are they different and when might you choose one over the other in a web development project?

  We can handle CSS responsiveness using media queries. A media query can define styles that will be applied on determined media types and on specific screen sizes. We can create how many media queries are needed to apply CSS responsiveness.
  The CSS Flexbox layout is designed for one-dimensional design (row or column). It allows to align, position and space HTML elements in a row or column.
  The Grid Layout system is designed for two-dimensional design (row and columns, at the same time). It allows to set horizontal and vertical lines to position HTML elements.
  To choose one over the other we can analyze whether the layout is one or two-dimensional. If we want to control the alignment by row or by column Flexbox is more useful. If we want to control the alignment by row and by column Grid Layout is more useful.
